Kotlin API for GitHub uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

- Before you log a bug, please search the issue tracker to see if someone has already reported the problem.

- If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.

- Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report. We like to know the Kotlin API for GitHub version, operating system, and JVM version you’re using.
